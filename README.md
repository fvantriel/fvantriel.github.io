# Easy Upload for your Website to Github Pages

If you want to always upload the latest state of your website automatically to Github pages,
you can use Peanut to significantly minimize your efforts:

https://pub.dev/packages/peanut

The bash script "push_code_and_website.sh" can be utilized to update your codebase and website in a few seconds (with the help of Peanut).
Please be aware that this script works with my environment but possible needs to be tailored to your needs and git setup.
